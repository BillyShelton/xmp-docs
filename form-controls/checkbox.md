# `<CheckBox>`

The CheckBox tag renders as a checkbox and associated label at run-time. A series of CheckBox controls provides a useful alternative to the CheckBoxList. With the CheckBoxList, all selected values are placed into a single string value that is sent to the data source. However, a series of individual CheckBox controls provides you with the same basic functionality as the CheckBoxList, but you also have the ability to store the value of each CheckBox in its own data field.

*   **BackColor**: Color of the background of the control.  

*   **BorderColor**: Color of the border around the control.

    ](../unit-types.md)
*   **Checked**: Determines whether the checkbox is checked.  

*   **CssClass**: Name of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) class used to style this control.  

*   **DataField**: Name of the parameter in the `<SubmitCommand>` which will be filled with this control's data on when the form is submitted and/or the parameter in the `<SelectCommand>` which will supply this control's data when the form is loaded. This attribute is required if the control will participate in operations with your form's data commands.  

*   **DataType**: The type of data this control is supplying to the data commands. This is a [Database type](../data-types.md). Valid values are: boolean only. This attribute is required if the control will participate in operations with your form's data commands.
