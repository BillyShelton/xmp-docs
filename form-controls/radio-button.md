# `<RadioButton>`

The RadioButton tag renders as a radio button and associated label at run-time. Using a series of RadioButton controls, along with the GroupName property, you can create a list of mutually exclusive options. This can be a useful alternative to using a RadioButtonList. With the RadioButtonList, only one value is sent to the datasource. If you use RadioButton controls that are grouped, you get the same mutually-exclusive options, but you also have the ability to store the value of each RadioButton in its own data field.

## Remarks



*   **AccessKey**: In browsers that support it, this property can be set to a character on the keyboard that can be used to set focus to the control. For instance, setting the value to F allows the user to access the control by pressing Alt+F on their keyboard (for Windows machines).  

*   **BackColor**: Color of the background of the control.  

*   **BorderColor**: Color of the border around the control.  

*   **BorderStyle**: Style of the border around the control.  

*   **BorderWidth**: Width of the border around the control, specified in [units](../unit-types.md)

*   **Checked**: Determines whether the radio button is checked.  

*   **CssClass**: Name of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) class used to style this control.  

*   **DataField**: Name of the parameter in the `<SubmitCommand>` which will be filled with this control's data on when the form is submitted and/or the parameter in the `<SelectCommand>` which will supply this control's data when the form is loaded. This attribute is required if the control will participate in operations with your form's data commands.  

*   **DataType**: The type of data this control is supplying to the data commands. This is a [Database type](../data-types.md). Valid values are: boolean only. This attribute is required if the control will participate in operations with your form's data commands.  

*   **Font Properties**: A series of attributes such as font-bold, font-size, etc. that allow you to control how the text in the control is displayed. [More](../font-properties.md)

*   **ForeColor**:Â Sets the foreground color (typically the color of the text) of the control.  

*   **GroupName**: The name of the group the radio button belongs to. Use this to create a grouping of radio buttons that form a mutually exclusive list of options. When this property is specified, only one radio button may be selected within that group at any given time.  

*   **Height**: Height of the control, specified in [units](../unit-types.md).  

*   **ID**: Name, consisting of letters and numbers, beginning with a letter, that uniquely identifies the control within the form.  

*   **Nullable**: If this is set to True, the control will return a DBNull value if the control has not been checked. If a DBNull value is passed to this control, regardless of the Nullable setting, the control will be un-checked.  

*   **Style**: Same as the HTML style attribute.It allows you to apply CSS styling to the control (e.g. `color: red; border: solid 1px black;`).  

*   **TabIndex**: Sets the tab index for the control.  

*   **Text**: The caption to display next to the radio button.  

*   **TextAlign**: The alignment of the text label with respect to its associated check box. Valid values are Left and Right. Default value is Right.  

*   **ToolTip**: In browsers that support it, sets the text to display when the mouse pointer hovers over the control.  

*   **Visible**: Determines if the control is visible (true) or hidden (false).  

*   **Width**: Width of the control in [units](../unit-types.md).
