# Activating Your License

In order to use XMod Pro on a web site, you must Activate the license. Please note that you may use XMod Pro for development purposes only on "localhost" (http://localhost). For all other uses you must activate the license. This is done through the License and Activation page. This page is only available to Hosts or SuperUser accounts. To get there, select "License and Activation" from the module's Actions/Manage Menu:

The License and Activation page allows you to check the status of your license. If you haven't yet activated, this page allows you to request a Trial License (a temporary license that will expire) or activate your license.
